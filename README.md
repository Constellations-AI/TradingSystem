# Constellations AI

**Intelligence, orchestrated.**

We specialize in orchestrating autonomous agents that operate with memory, context, and purpose. At Constellations AI, our focus is on the architecture layer that enables agents to collaborate, adapt, and act intelligently across domains.

## Portfolio Projects

### Multi-Agent Trading System
A sophisticated trading platform featuring autonomous AI agents with distinct trading personalities. Each agent combines technical analysis with LLM-based reasoning to interpret market data, news sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. The system demonstrates real-time multi-agent coordination and decision-making in financial markets.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, React, TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4, LangChain, Polygon API, SQLite

### Digital Twin Assistant (Coming Soon)
A fine-tuned personal assistant designed for secure environments, featuring federated learning and dual-memory architecture for air-gapped deployments.

### Course of Action Generation (Coming Soon)
Unity-based simulation framework for autonomous behavior across multiple domains using reinforcement learning and hybrid A* path planning.
